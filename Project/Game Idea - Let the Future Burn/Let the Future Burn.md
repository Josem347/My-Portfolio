"It's 2078, Companys have taken over the world, people are nothing more than assets, cheap hand work. The Human Rights are
 being dissolved, Earth is dying, resources are scarce, and Men in Suits are the ones that tell what everyone can and can't
 do. There is no hope and no one seems to have enough guts to face this menace... plus t-the Machines are revolting and also
 Aliens are invading!... But then... The Executives messed with the wrong people, they threatened to cancel the most popular
 reality show on the planet "Little Big Bro" and that was unacceptable! Rebels rised and are prepared to fight everything 
 and everyone to protect their reality...show cause if they succeed in their devilish plans, we might as well let the future
 BURN!!!"

A fast paced "Broforce-ish" game, focused on shooting and destroying everyone who dares to stand in the way of the rebellion!
fight, rush, collect Weapons and make your way to the biggest corporation in the World "WeBuyEverythingWeFeelLikeInc" to con-
front them. Pick a character among a big and timid Biker, a furius and fast Punk and an existencialist cyborg.

This project is just a Prototype, there's a lot of ideas i wanted to try it out but i couldn't make in time to deliver and 
show in the Forms. This was made in Game Maker and down below there are other files with the codes, assets (Which were NOT
made by me, i downloaded at Itch.io, Pixel art is REALLY hard and it's my first time working with it), and documents showing
steps on game design.

I made a little prototype to be playede, but unfotunately i had a lot of trouble with the GameMaker plataform and i wasn't able to create the exe in order to show it. I have all the assets and codes i made based on Youtube tutorials down bellow.
I also made a Figma document to showcase a future Menu and Level.
