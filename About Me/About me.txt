My name is Jos√© Mateus, i am 20 years old, born and raised in Manaus - Amazonas and currently studying Information Systems
at Fametro. I play videogames since i was a child and ever since i can remember creativity has always been a part of me, 
creating stories is something that i do on a daily basis and i'm actually really proud of that. I like to write, i like to
write game reviews, movie reviews, some poems or thoughts, feelings, whatever i feel like really it depends on my inspira-
tions sometimes. When talking about the art on a game and music it's also something i love, that i dream on being able to
work with and that i plan on getting good at, on knowing how to compose, how to design characters, until then i try my best
at it. This artistic aspect of my personality is something i've been exploring throughout the years which sincerely just
made me apreciate even more games, the experience of being part of story, the quality and the paralles of the narratives,
creative plotlines and gameplay aspects, being fun just for the sake of it and the list goes on, but to me what i value
the most is the passion put onto it, cause even if the game is not as good as it could, you can feel all the love put into
production and gameplay, and it just makes all of if more pleasant and fun to go through. Doing what you love is just that 
amazing and i would be more than glad to have the oportunity for it.
